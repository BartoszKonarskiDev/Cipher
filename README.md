**WORK IN PROGRESS RN NO CODE YET**
Here will be clearly named varibels cuz i noticed no way im expanding code with old ones, removed the NOT until further notice, removed some useless stuff like previus varible r that i frogot to dealte from when i was testing if it reads reapets correctly and they were seperate from the key(pre version 1.0, didnt bother posting it, couldnt even read letters) aswell as finaly learend what types of cyphers are out there and figured mine is closest to ARX so ima add rotate in next version
