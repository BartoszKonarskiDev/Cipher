# Cipher-v1.0
Its the 1st code i made at 1st, its varibales are named terribly and few ussless opretions are in place probably, comments there explein the code to me if i wanted to fall back on what does what cuz im begginer in c++
How it works is xor, addmod, xor, NOT, next version gonna have ussless expleitons in comments removed, cleaned up variabels and whatever else i put in changelogs there
