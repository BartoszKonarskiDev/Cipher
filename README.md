# Cipher
A toy cypher im working on, got no idea on either cryptograhpy or c++ well rn so dont use it for any real secuirty, im planning for it to eventualy beceome a full 128 bit key ARX but still its going to suck compare to anything else
also side note as of writning this im 16 so dont mind the language
Current Road map is smh along those lines:
**v2** is adding rotations;
**v3** is making it not read repeatitons from the key, insted them being fixed;
**v4** figuring out how to generate those long keys;
**v5** probably the final product if its not v4 or if i dont decide to add more stuff that deserve full version;
