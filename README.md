# Cipher
A toy cypher im working on, got no idea on either cryptograhpy or c++ well rn so dont use it for any real secuirty, im planning for it to eventualy beceome a full 128 bit key ARX but still its going to suck compare to anything else
also side note as of writning this im 16 so dont mind the language
All versions are in the branches, only final one gonna be in main
Current Road map of major versions is smh along those lines:
**v2** is adding rotations and making the final algoritm(gonna be addmod, rotation, xor, rotation, addmod, rotation,xor) insted of placeholder of v1 ;
**v3** figuring out how to generate those long keys;
**v4** will change from per charaacter to per block(probably an 16 byte block) and changing the cipher output from decimal to hex;;
**v5** is making it not read rounds from the key, insted them being fixed, probably final version;
